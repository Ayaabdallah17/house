        One of the most famous questions we have always encountered from our friends who love Star Coffee 
        is what is this delicious coffee that you bring,
        is this Brazilian coffee or what?
        </p>
        <p>
        The secret that we would like to tell you is that we love coffee from the bottom of our hearts just as you are,
        coffee beans cannot meet the hands of people who love them and find pleasure and happiness in preparing them and not be delicious,
        so our first secret is your presence that gives our coffee beans the happiness and adds to their artificiality the value .
        </p>
        <p>
        But the second secret, which is more practical, is that we are keen to combine the best types of coffee,
        and we spend a lot of time preparing and trying coffee in the various available ways,
        in addition to that we are always trying to put our own touch which we think you like and that's why you are in our world full of coffee and your smiles.
